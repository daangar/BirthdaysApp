# Architecture

I created this project using an implementation of Clean Architecture and divided it in 3 leayers: **domain**, **data** and **presentation**

# Components

I used the following components in the project:

- **Couritines**
- **Koin**
- **Retrofit**
- **Mockito**
- **ViewModels**
- **LiveData**
- **MVVM Pattern**

# Notes

With more time I could have finished the presentation layer and fixed the Koin initialization problem in the test
